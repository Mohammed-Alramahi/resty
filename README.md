# Component Based UI

## Description:

Refactor the RESTy application as follows:

Begin with installing and running the application, making note of itâ€™s architecture
The App component serves as the container for all sub-components of this application
Leave this component as a Class
The app imports an .scss file to serve as the base design for the site
Header, Footer, Results and Form components are imported from other files using ES6 import syntax
Each of the components use their own .scss file for styling
The <Form> component should:
Call back to the <App/> component via function sent down through a prop so that the app can begin the process
The <Results/> component should show mock API results.
